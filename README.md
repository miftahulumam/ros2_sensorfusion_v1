# Deep Learning Inference for LiDAR - Camera Fusion

This repository provides the source code for acquiring data from LiDAR and cameras, 
performing deep-learning-based depth estimation and extrinsic calibration. 
This source code was developed as part of the sensor fusion and 
computer fusion research project at [WiComAI Lab](https://wireless.kookmin.ac.kr/) of Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea.
